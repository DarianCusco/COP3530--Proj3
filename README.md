# COP3530--Proj3
In order to run code you just run main.cpp. This reads in the CSV and proccesses the data through our two
data structures (bins & hash tables). Then we spit the data back into a JSON file for our website to be able to access. Last use a live server or this link (https://dariancusco.github.io/COP3530--Proj3/src/index.html) to access finished website. Hope you enjoy!!!
